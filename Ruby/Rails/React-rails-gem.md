# React-Rails Gem

## Install

- `gem 'react-rails'`
- bundle
- `rails g react:install`

## Usage

So I went and did the research, talked to senior developers to find out the best practices. 
Use Object Views.
IMPORTANT: Views should only display already computed values. **

## Troubles

- when rails g react:install does not work and returning `prepend` `nil` class
   * `bundle update`
